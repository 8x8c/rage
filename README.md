# rage: Rust implementation of age

age is meant to be a simple, secure and modern encryption tool with small
explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style composability.

- The spec is at https://age-tool.com.
- The reference implementation is https://github.com/FiloSottile/age.

This implementation is in progress, and things will keep moving around in the
near future, so it's not yet a good time to contribute, and it's definitely not
a good time to rely on it.
